Peeter Tarvas <h2>206776IAIB</h2>. Hi, this is my personal website. This website is in the makeing and will not be puhlished because its a homework.
I do not intend to do anything special form this website. If you want to see a real website the go to
 <a href="https://taltech.ee/">Taltech</a>.
I do not prefer to do this but the next has to be 100 words long so it will take some time to do this.
I really like Tarantino films, they are very pretty and the have "easter eggs" and other stuff. Also game of thrones is really cool
I find the last four seasons to be bad but other wise it was cool. Anyway my intrests are alos skateboarding,
snowbording, partying, reading books and chilling. The best book of all time is Master and Margarite by Dostayevsky
Also did you know that the Master and Margarite was banned in Communist Russia because it depicted religion
and also the first copy of it was stored somewhere in a addic in an Estonian cottage for 10 yeasr or something.
Finally in 1960s it was released and the first copys of it were in Estonian. Its a really good book and I would recomend it to you.
